            Hello!
            Welcome to my website! My name is Sofia Chalkiadaki. Let's get to know each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            I always thought my dream was to be in a chemisty lab, experimenting with different molecules and be the next breakthrough in Science. This dream goes well with my Master's degree in Drug Discovery & Development @ Imperial College London. I started my first job in an analytical lab where I would spend half of my time in the lab and the rest in front of the PC analysing data.
